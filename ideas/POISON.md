# Theme: Poison (Draft)

Core fantasy: attrition, inevitability, and "dirty" tempo tools (cleanse, resist, amplify).

Rules (locked in):
- Poison stack: integer status; stacks do not decay.
- Poison tick: start of a player's turn, if stacks ≥1, take a small flat damage (does not scale with stacks).
- Poison application: any single effect that would add stacks counts as 1 application, regardless of stack amount.

Cards:
1. Gas Grenade (active)
   - Apply poison stacks to both players immediately (one application each).
2. Antidote (active)
   - Remove all poison stacks from the player (does not remove poison-causing statuses).
3. Gas Mask (status, charges)
   - Prevent the next X poison applications to the player (1 charge per application), then destroy itself.
4. Extra Filter (active)
   - Refresh charges of an existing Gas Mask.
5. Poison Drink (active)
   - Apply a large amount of stacks (tick is still flat per turn).
6. Poison Darts (status)
   - End of the target's turn: apply 1 poison stack.

Legendary:
7. Zombie (permanent status/transformation)
   - Poison stacks also count as health; the player cannot heal.
8. Acid Blood (reactive status)
   - When attacked, attacker takes damage based on your poison stacks.
