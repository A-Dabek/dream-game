# Theme: Martial Arts (Draft)

Core fantasy: tempo control, counters, and "clean" skill expression (stances, interrupts, punishes).

Cards:
1. Counterattack (status)
   - Next enemy attack that would deal damage: negate it and deal flat damage back. Attacking yourself removes Counterattack with no trigger.
2. Headlock (status)
   - If the enemy would take consecutive turns before you act, those extra enemy turns are passed until your turn.
3. Guard (passive)
   - Reduce incoming damage by a flat amount. If damage would be applied to you twice in a row, Guard is destroyed.
4. Low Kick (active)
   - Deal low damage. If the enemy is faster, they lose their next turn.
5. Parry (status, charges)
   - Gain charges equal to items left in hand. If incoming damage equals charges: negate it and deal that amount back; else: Parry stays and attacker takes 1.
6. Combo (passive + activatable)
   - While in hand: +1 combo stack each turn you deal any damage consecutively; breaks if you don't deal damage. When played: deal damage = stacks (playing it doesn't consume stacks).
7. Meditate (status)
   - Heal each turn and reduce incoming damage by %; removed if you attack.

Legendary:
8. Karate Belt (build-around)
   - Playing Martial Arts cards upgrades belt color/potency; generates new cards based on color when activated.
9. Duel (legendary active)
   - Set both speeds to 10; enemy starts next turn. Duration: permanent.
