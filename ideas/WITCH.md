# Theme: Witch (Draft)

Core fantasy: brewing, improvisation, and ritual-like sequencing (order matters).

Legendary:

1. Cauldron (legendary build-around)
   - Using Witch items adds an ingredient to the Cauldron. Different orders yield different effects.
   - When brewing, choose the output form: Potion (active), Charm (passive), or Hex (status).
   - Three separate Witch items claim Cauldron results (one per form), so you can create all 3 if enough ingredients are gathered.

Ingredients (names; effects TBD):

- Moonwater, Sunwater, Starlight Dew, Rainwater Vial, Sea Salt, Black Salt, Grave Dirt, Bone Dust, Ashes, Charcoal Powder,
- Iron Nail, Silver Shavings, Quartz Shard, Obsidian Chip,
- Mandrake Root, Wolfsbane, Nightshade, Belladonna Bloom, Mugwort, Sage Bundle, Rosemary Sprig, Thyme Bunch, Lavender,
- Poppy Seeds, Toadstool Cap, Morel Spores, Raven Feather, Bat Wing, Toad Skin, Snake Fang, Spider Silk, Bee Honey,
- Bitter Vinegar, Dragon's Blood Resin
